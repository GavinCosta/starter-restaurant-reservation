# Restaurant Reservation System - Capstone Project

Welcome to the README page for the Restaurant Reservation System, a capstone project developed by Gavin Costa.

## Project Overview

This project is a reservation system designed specifically for fine dining restaurants. As a full stack developer at Periodic Tables, a startup dedicated to revolutionizing the restaurant industry, I was tasked with creating a robust reservation system that enables restaurant personnel to manage reservations efficiently. The system facilitates the creation, modification, and tracking of reservations, ensuring that restaurant managers can provide exceptional service to their customers.

## User Stories Implemented

The features of the system are driven by the following user stories:

- **Create and List Reservations**
- **Create Reservation on a Future, Working Date**
- **Create Reservation Within Eligible Timeframe**
- **Seat Reservation**
- **Finish an Occupied Table**
- **Reservation Status**
- **Search for a Reservation by Phone Number**
- **Change an Existing Reservation**

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (with support for Chrome)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL
- **Additional Tools**: Knex.js for database queries, Jest for testing

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the system fulfills the core requirements outlined in the user stories, there are several areas for potential enhancement:

- Implementing user authentication and authorization for secure access to the system.
- Adding support for email notifications to remind customers about their upcoming reservations.
- Enhancing the user interface for a more intuitive and visually appealing experience.
- Implementing additional features such as table management and reporting capabilities.
